            <h2>Understanding Cricket</h2>
            <img src="./cricket1.webp" alt="Understanding Cricket Image" class="section-image">
            At its core, cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams. The objective is straightforward: score more runs than the opposition. A match consists of innings, where each team takes turns to bat and bowl.

            A cricket field is an expansive ground with a rectangular pitch at its center. The pitch is where most of the action occurs—a strip of carefully prepared grass with two sets of wooden stumps at each end.

            A team typically consists of 11 players, each with specific roles—batsmen, bowlers, and fielders. The batsmen aim to score runs, while bowlers try to dismiss them by bowling the ball. Fielders support by preventing runs and taking catches.

            <img src="./" alt="Types of Matches Image" class="section-image">
            Cricket offers various formats, each with its own rules and durations. The most common are Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and the fast-paced Twenty20 (T20) matches.
            Test matches are the oldest and traditionally the longest, spanning five days. ODIs are limited to 50 overs per side, whereas T20s are completed in about three hours, fostering an electrifying atmosphere.
